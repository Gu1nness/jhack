summary: Cli tool packed with juju hacks.

description: |
  An opinionated collection of scripts and utilities to make
  charming charming again. Many of the scripts in jhack interact with the juju snap and
  communicate with its client by issuing `juju` cli calls.
  This snap requires write access to ~/.local/share/juju via an interface named
  dot-local-share-juju, so that the juju client configuration can be used to talk to the
  user's clouds, controllers and models. Also, on machine models, you will need to connect the 
  `ssh-keys` plug so that jhack can run `juju ssh` on your behalf.
