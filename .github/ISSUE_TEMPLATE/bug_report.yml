        We need to know a bit more about the context in which you run jhack.
        - The output of `jhack jenv`
        - Juju, k8s, multipass, lxd versions, if relevant.

        Please copy and paste any relevant log output. 
        More output can be obtained by running jhack with the `--loglevel=DEBUG` flag.
        For example: `jhack --loglevel=DEBUG fire foo/0 myevent`.
        If it's too long to put here, link to a pastebin. You can ask jhack to log to file by doing:
        `jhack --loglevel=DEBUG fire --log-to-file=./jhack-logs.txt foo/0 myevent`
